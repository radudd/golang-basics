## Types

* library packages - designed to be consumed by another packages
** the name *MUST* match directory name

* main packages 

** application entrypoint
** contains main() function
** can be in any directory name
** focused on app setup and initialization

## Naming

* nouns
* explicit
* no underscores
* carefull with abbreviations

## Lifecycle

1. packages are imported
2. variables are initialiazed
3. init function is called to dynamically reinit the variables

### init() function




## Visibility

Scopes: 

* public scope 
** Capitalize 
** Available for any member of package or consumer of package

* package-level scope
** start with lower-case letter
** available only for package members

* internal package (not the same as private)
** parent package and its descendent can access it
** cannot be accessed outside trees

## Documention

* Document package
* Document its members
** document public API

## Designing best practices

* package should be focused on a specific solution 
** do a single thing
** consistent API

* package should focus on the consumer
** simple to use
** minimize API
** encapsulate changes / i.e. return an interface if your objects will evolve over time

* maximize reusability
** reduce dependencies
** minimize scope

## Design interfaces

* receive concrete types when we need to receive configuration
* receive interface when we need to receive behaviours

* return concrete types is preferrable for both config and behaviour
* return errors and avoid panics

Concrete types receive:
* net/http.Request
Interface types receive:
* net/http.Handler
Concrete types retuns:
* net/http.Response
Error returs:
* net/http.Get

## Importing packages

* standard
* alias

----
lmjson "pluralsight.com/libmanager/json"
----

* for side effect. when you only want to init the package but not used it, i.e. running the init functions. Commonly used when importing database drivers.

----
_ "github.com/lib/pq"
----

Example:

----
import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
)
----

SQL will manage interaction to database, but it needs the driver. 

* internal packages. Must reside in `internal` directory - will be accessible only by parents

* relative imports - like navigating to directories. They are not valid in modules or workspaces, only for prototyping

* vendored dirctory. Create a structury of directories in your own package under vendor directory.

----
mkdir -p vendor/github.com/google/uuid
